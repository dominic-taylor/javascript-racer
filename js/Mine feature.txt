minus two frm the player state.

Changed race car colours and added mine class. 
Next make mine class send you back 2 spaces.
Make mine class random. 

if mine.cell == ativie.cell
    active cell back 2.

Have added feature that drops a mine on a random cell of the track for both players. 
When the player hits the mine, there car is set back 2 spaces. SO far there is only 
one mine each for both players, which they must hit. What else do I want from this? 
Multiple lanes? A player can decide to cross the lane instead of hitting the mine. 
Mines appear more for the leader? Mines appear after the first has been taken out? 

If one player is ahead of the other by a certain number of moves they get a mine on their track?
